## General Information
This is our work for the project of Internet of Things course of the 2020-2021 academic year.
The task of this project is to create a series of light patterns on a system consisting of 1 controller node and 9 “smart light” nodes, set up in the following structure. 
We have decided to use the following three patterns:
● Triangle
● Cross
● Diamond
These patterns must be repeated in the same sequence periodically and, after one pattern has been sent, all the nodes have to be switched off before switching them on according to the next pattern.
Finally, it is required to simulate the project with Cooja showing the nodes with their respective LEDs.
You can read the detailed report of out work [here](https://github.com/AlessiaGuzzo/Smart-Lights-Project-IoT/blob/main/Smart%20Lights%20Project%20Report.pdf).


## Tools
We have used *TinyOS* for the executable code of the motes and *Cooja* for their simulation, in particular we have used the _nesC_ language.
